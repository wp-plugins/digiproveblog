== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I uploaded the plug-in and nothing seems to happen when I publish a new or edited post? =

- Have you registered with Digiprove yet (see Installation)?
- Have you activated your Digiprove registration by clicking on the link received by email?
- If you have not received the activation mail, check your junk mail folder, then contact us at support@digiprove.com


= What is the plugin page?  =

[Copyright Proof](http://www.digiprove.com/copyright_proof_wordpress_plugin.aspx)


= What's with the registration process?  =

The Digiprove service needs to have the name of the person claiming copyright, and valid email address to which Digiprove content certificates will be sent.  There is an "activation" step whereby you click on the link in an email we send you before your registration becomes active.

Digiprove does not make use of these details except to deliver the service.  Please read the terms of use (including privacy policy) at http://www.digiprove.com/termsofuse_page.aspx

= Your web-site appears to be commercial.  Is this going to cost me anything?  =

There is no cost for personal use (or use by an educational establishment) of the Digiprove service via this plug-in.  It is also free for commercial use via this beta version of the plug-in.


= How does this protect copyright? =

Note that in most countries, you are already the copyright owner of any original work (literary or otherwise) that you have created, as soon as you record or publish it (whether or not you subsequently go through a formal registration process).  By Digiproving your work, you are creating time-stamped evidence that you are the possessor of that content, which is the critical factor in ensuring you can prove your ownership (or someone else's plagiarism).

In some countries, you can go a step further by formally registering your copyright in your work as it is created/published or subsequently.  There is usually a fee for this, and the benefits vary from country to country - in the U.S. for instance this should be done prior to instituting any legal proceedings for breach of copyright.

Digiproving your work is something that is done conveniently and will provide proof of ownership pre-dating any official copyright registration.

= I think I've found a bug, what can I do? =

This is a beta version of the plug-in, and we actively seek information about problems or criticisms you may have.  So please let us know at support@digiprove.com - we will address the problem as soon as possible. 


= Can I review my history of Digiproving online? =

Yes, you can review your history online (and perform other functions) by visiting https://www.digiprove.com/members/my_digiprove.aspx - you will need to log in using your Digiprove user id and password.


= I'm a developer - how do I link directly to Digiprove API?  =

Use of the Digiprove API from other applications is free for personal or educational use.  Details of the (Soap) API are found at www.digiprove.com/resources.aspx
